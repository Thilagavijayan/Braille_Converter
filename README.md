## Overview
This website allows you to convert and learn braille. The webpage represents the bumps on brialle with six dots (two columns, three rows). To depict a raised state, the dot becomes dark; otherwise, the bump is not raised and stays light. The website allows you to translate braille characters to and from the English alphabet. You may also put yourself to the test and try to beat your own results!


## Technologies
- HTML / CSS
- JavaScript

## Usage
There are three main features of the website:  
- Braille to Alphabet
  - You may change the status of the dots by tapping on them, and by hitting *convert*, the computer will decide which alphabet character is represented.
- Test Yourself
  - The application will prompt you to represent an alphabet character. If you input the alphabet character properly, your time will be compared to your best time ever.
  - If the alphabet character supplied is incorrect, the correct character will be shown.
- Generate Braille
  - When alphabet characters are entered into a text field, the equivalent braille is shown underneath.
